UNDANGAN.MU
===========

Startup providing services to make wedding invitations in the form of a website. Users can choose a design, enter event information such as event location, etc., as well as change the information that you want to display. 

Developed using Laravel & PostgreSQL

This project is an MVP that I created iteratively for several weeks. However I later found that this project may require more maintenance & resource than I could reasonably spare, so I decided to abandon it and open source its code. I would be happy if it could be a source for learning for other people.
